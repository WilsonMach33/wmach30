            <th>One day, a bear was walking through a forest. After following the path for hours, he saw a bee hive. The bear was hungry after walking the entire day. Honey was the perfect snack! The bear ran up to the hive, grabbed the bee hive, and ran. He didn't realize that the bees could fly faster than he could run. The bees caught up to him and stung him multiple times. Desperate, he threw the hive away and jumped in the river. However, he couldn't swim! He fell deeper and deeper into the water until a hand grabbed him. <br>"Bear, are you ok?" <br>The bear grabbed the hand. "Yeah."<br> And that's how Bear got his name. </th>
